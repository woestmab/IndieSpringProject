This week I spent most of my time working through the activities from git.  I had some trouble getting hibernate to work at first but then I found that it was a very simple fix and it was up and running.  I can already see how using hibernate really speeds up the database commands and is much more intuitive than sql.  I found that I was guessing what the commands were before I would even need to look them up.
