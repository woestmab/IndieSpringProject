This week I spend a while working through the exercise for using passwords with Apache.  I got pretty far along in it but it doesn't seem to want to connect to the database so after I write this I'm going to check it out some more.  I did a little research and had a go at using the Google API for doing directions.  I found that the API is going to work perfectly and will be able to pass objects to the frontend as json objects.  I'm thinking that to use Java I might create a pojo that holds a bunch of json strings or something like that.  I haven't fully thought it out yet and I want to focus on getting my system talking to Google for starters.  I did some investigating into Spring framework and it looks like it has some great tools for RESTful web services that can help me pass json to the front end too.
