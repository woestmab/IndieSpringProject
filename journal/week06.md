This week I worked on the class activities but I wasn't able to get all the way through #3.  I got everything to work but for some reason when I was creating my war it didn't have the HelloWorld like yours did in the example.  I was using the same project, JunitDemo, so that I could follow along exactly as you were doing in yours.  I did a little bit more on my calendar part of my jsp and I also build the beginning of some servlets for my web app.  I'm thinking that I just have some conflicting js implementation from one of the files that I linked to the website.  Haha!  Immediately after closing out this journal I found the error.  Just missed a css file :)
