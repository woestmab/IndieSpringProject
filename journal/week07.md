This week I realized that I was deviating from my project plan so I tried to get back on the right track.  It's not really a problem that I changed up how I was progressing because I'm still working on parts of the project.  I ended up putting in more time in the beginnning on the frontend because I like the design and got side tracked with bootstrap.  I began this week with some work on my testing and tried to get Spring working in my project.  I thought that it would be wise to use a concept that I'm already familiar with, JDBC, as a part of Spring to focus on.  It seememd almost identical to Hibernate so I might want to continue to see what other options Spring has so that I can learn something new.  I will save that for the end of the project as an addition to the "if I have time" todo list.  I was able to offer some help to other students this week who wanted some advice on a couple things I've learned on my own.  It's really cool to be able to help others and share the knowledge that I've picked up along the way.
