This week and over spring break I worked on getting some requests to send to Google API and return a response.  I was finally able to figure it out and now I have, what seems to be, a fully working response with data in a json.  I am now focusing on getting the json converted into a usable format that java can understand.  Google has a class that should do the trick and it's called gson.  I have been bouncing back and fourth between the group project and the indie project using parts of each one to further the other.  That methodology seems to be keeping me up to date.  I have deviated from my schedueled tasks a little bit by working more on the front end when I got started so my schedule is a little off now.
