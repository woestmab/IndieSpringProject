This week I focused on helping our group get organized.  We got our project outlined and set up most of the core parts of the team project so I think we're in great shape now.  I personally worked on the gson class to understand how it converts an incoming json into a pojo.  It works very well and I will be able to take what I learned and use it in both the team and individual projects.
