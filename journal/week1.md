This week I decided on creating a web app that will figure out the bus (or maybe biking) routes based on an input schedule.  The idea is to be able to enter your scheduling info to the online calendar using a gui that you can click and then fill in a form to figure out the best routes for a given day.  I think that I will have a pretty easy time getting the data since there are a few pretty good apps out on iTunes that already do similar things.  I've never seen one that can take into account the weather so I figured that it's a good bet that I'm not alone in wishing for this feature.  I thought that I should give some rough estimates for how long it will take me to do each part of the project but not be too elaborate with it until I get through my preliminary diagrams. I plan on making some wireframe drawings to try and lock down what I think the site should look like and then move on to some development after that.  Not much else to report for this week :)
