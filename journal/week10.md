This week I mostly worked on getting my tests working for all my database classes.  As I was working on that I had the realization that I may have created a mess for myself by allowing the user to log addresses.  Really it should just be lat & long coords and then google can do the rest.  So, assuming I have time, the best solution would be to make a request to Google so that I can verify the address before saving it.  I don't want my addresses to be invalid when I return them to the frontend.  Good thing I added time for debugging!
