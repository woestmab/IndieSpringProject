This week I haven't had much time to work on my individual project but I put a lot of effort into the group project instead.  I'm hoping to have more time this week to get some momentum and get my front end done.  I still need to rethink my database and figure out how I'm going to check my addresses when they're entered in the front end form but before they're stored in the database.
