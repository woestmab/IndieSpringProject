This week I had a blast out on the ropes course.  I think that it would be a great thing to do for all classes in the future.  On my individual project this week I worked on the form submission for location data.  I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by all the work that needs to be done in all my classes for this final push.  I know I will get it done but it sure can be stressful when there is so much to do.
