This week I finally had some time to work on Java and I made some real progress on my application.  I was able to query google to get the bus information and save a parsed version of their string.  I created a modal for my index page that is a functioning "create appointment" form that submits to my database after validation.  I tried something new that I thought of for my validation that uses an interface to pass in generic Form objects to my validation class.
