This week I did the exercise that was posted in git and was pleasantly surprised when it worked the first time I fired it up.  That's pretty much unheard of so I was a bit shocked and thought maybe I messed something up and it was a false success.  I continued to create some tests to double check the math on my calculations and everything seemed ok.  I also created a test to check for a NullPointerException if you were to pass in a null array which came back with the correct error.  The testing was pretty straight forward and I thought it was pretty interesting once I got IntelliJ working thanks to Justin's help.  Slack sure is a great way to help each other with problems and it really adds to how much we're learning because it reinforces our ideas.

Were the journals based on a suggestion by one of the surveys?  I posted a comment with a similar idea and I wondered if that was from me or if it was planned ahead of time.  Either way I like it!
