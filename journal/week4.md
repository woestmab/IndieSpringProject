I was able to get through my ERD this week and I used a new website to test it out called [Vertabelo] http://www.vertabelo.com/.  I spent a fair amount of time working with a Bootstrap calendar that someone made and I'm going to try to implement its usage into my project.  It seemed to work fairly well and I really like the way it looks.  The code reviews went really well once we got a feel for it and I think our group is going to work out well for that.  I got some good feedback on my ERD and I'm looking forward to getting deeper into the project to see what I can accomplish this weekend.
